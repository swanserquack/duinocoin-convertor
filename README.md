# Duinocoin-Convertor

This is a fan made project, it has no relation to the duino-coin team or the [main repository](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin). This program is a simple program which converts to and from duino-coin, using the prices from the [coingecko api](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation).
