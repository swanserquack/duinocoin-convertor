# Duinocoin-Convertor

This is a fan made project, it has no relation to the duino-coin team or the [main repository](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin). This program is a simple program which converts to and from duino-coin.

Things To Add:
* [ ] More currencies to convert to
* [ ] Improve usability
* [ ] Reduce Amount of elif statements
* [ ] Overall Efficiency Changes
* [ ] Add togglable warnings about which currencies cannot be directly converted to
